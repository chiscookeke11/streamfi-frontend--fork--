### How to Report

    - Include a description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - Potential impact.
3.  **Wait for a response.** We acknowledge all security reports within 48 hours.

### Response Process

1.  **Triage:** We will review your report and determine its validity and severity.
2.  **Fix:** We will work on a fix in a private branch.
3.  **Release:** We will release a security patch and publish a security advisory.

### Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have an official bug bounty program, but we appreciate your responsible disclosure and will credit you in our release notes (with your permission).
